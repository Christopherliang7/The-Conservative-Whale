# The Conservative Whale

This is a project I worked on during my time at Hack Reactor. Built with Javascript, React, Node, Express, MySQL, deployed with AWS. 

API Usage:
- The Whale Hotline API http://hotline.whalemuseum.org/api
- Google Maps API https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview

Installation Instructions:
- npm install
- npm start
- npm run dev

This project was built as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a two day sprint. Initial implementation of retrieving whale sightings (with The Whale Hotline API) near your location through geolocation (with google maps API) with the idea of spreading awareness of wildlife conservation.

This application retrieves data from scientists of recent wildlife sitings with exact coordinates for mapping. Visitors to this page can also submit their own postings, stored into MySQL database, which will subsequently be rendered onto the feed. The home page will also display up-to-date statistics and mapping of marine species sitings, the quantity of these species all together and individually. By having these interactions, The Conservative Whale aims to foster a community of like-minded individuals to promote the importance of wildlife conservation and conservation as a whole.

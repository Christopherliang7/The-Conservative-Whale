# The Conservative Whale

This is a project I worked on during my time at Hack Reactor. Built with Javascript, React, Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, deployed with Heroku. 

Installation Instructions:
- npm install
- npm start
- npm run dev

Originally built as an MVP for a two day sprint. Initial implementation of retrieving whale sightings (with The Whale Hotline API) near your location through geolocation (with google maps API) with the idea of spreading awareness of wildlife conservation.

Future Implementations include User Authentication, Live Feed, and Posts.
